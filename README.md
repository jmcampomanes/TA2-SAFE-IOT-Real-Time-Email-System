# TA2-SAFE-IOT-Real-Time-Email-System

Air pollution and the presence of harmful gases in the environment result in serious health risks, especially in urban and industrial areas. Our project addresses this issue by providing a low-cost, real-time detection system that can identify whether air quality is clean, moderate, or polluted and whether gas is present in the area. This helps raise awareness and provide immediate alerts for preventive measures.
